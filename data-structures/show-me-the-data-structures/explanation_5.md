## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
The linked list structure provides an ideal foundation for blockchain implementation due to its natural chain representation, O(1) block addition efficiency, dynamic memory allocation, and seamless support for blockchain's core features like immutability and hash linking between blocks.

## Time Efficiency:

* Block Addition: O(1);
 * Due to tail pointer, new blocks are added in constant time
 * Hash calculation is also constant time operation

* Block Retrieval by Index: O(n);
 * Requires traversing the list from head
 * Linear time complexity as no random access
 * Could be improved using additional data structures if frequent access needed

* Chain Validation (implicit through structure): O(1)
 * Each block maintains previous block's hash
 * Immediate validation possible when adding new blocks

## Space Efficiency:
* Total Space: O(n)
 * Linear space complexity where n is number of blocks
 * No duplicate storage or overhead structures
